## Custom RSE-styled Kanto Overworld Sprites
- Overworld Sprites
- Mudskip

The spritesheets below are just a preview, the sprites are formatted individually in their subfolders.

### NOTE:
- Sprites with `_extended` in their file name has 1 extra unique facing frames, and is for sprites that is asymmetrical.
  They are already formatted to be ready-to-use and uses the same palette as their normal variant. However, it does requires a new object event anims for them to work in-game.
<!-- TODO: A small guide for implementing the said object event animation? -->
